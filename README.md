## Project Description

> This project is a weather forecast web application that uses the **WEATHER API** to retrieve weather data of a particular city and present it to the user in response to their entry.

> It was built to demonstrate the use of **async/await** and **Promises** in javascript to write asynchronous code as well as use **fetch** to retrieve data from an API.
